        <div class="poem-title"></div>
        <div class="poem">
            I used to hear the laughter, so silly and sweet,<br>
			Echoing in the kitchen as we placed the feast.<br> 
			Each voice whispering, " Stay, just for a while "<br>
			A cradle of unknowing comfort, a fleeting smile.<br>

			You used to say you love us dearly;<br>
			Words we believed, though spoken insincerely.<br>
			And on a foggy December night,<br>
			I bid goodbye - I had lost the will to fight.<br> 

			He used to ask if we regret being your daughter,<br> 
			Funny, a father with guilt unmet.<br>
			Or maybe he remembered your vows at the altar;<br>
			Promising us, home, and warmth would never falter.<br>

			Our neighbors used to gossip, "Such a picturesque frame,"<br>
			A family to keep in the ones you play in the VTR game.<br>
			Staring at our window, hoping they could have what we have,<br>
			Now, nothing's left than a heart shattered in half.<br> 

			But why did you leave us, forsaking your part?<br>
			Was the weight of regret too much for your heart?<br>
			Didn't you say we were your only trust?<br>
			Then why leave us stranded, like a cloud of dust?

        <div class="poem">
            We're parallel lines.<br>
			Our hearts will get closer and closer,<br>
			But fate is meant to keep us apart.<br>
			We flipped the page of our book<br>
			Only to see it led us to different pages<br>

			I trace the crosswalk of buried memories,<br> 
			Each stride a pulse of what we could have been.<br> 
			Yet the signal light abruptly turns red,<br> 
			A silent signal to halt my sweven.<br> 

			Your shadow lingers on the pavement,<br> 
			But shadows never flank, only trails.<br> 
			We both speak in the silence of intersections,<br> 
			Voices drowned by the sailing time.<br> 
			
			What if, for just a moment,<br> 
			The line could break and bend?<br>
			Would the distance crumble into dust,<br> 
			Or would the chaos tear us apart again?<br>

			As I stand in the middle of this crossing,<br> 
			I realize we are bound by the rules of our lane - our destiny:<br> 
			To walk forward and depart but never entwine,<br> 
			To meet only where paths momentarily align.

		 <p class="literary-title" onclick="toggleliterary(this)">Cultural Materialism on Guy de Maupassant's The Piece of String</p>
		<div class="literary-author">by Katrina C. Lavador, MAED- ELT</div>
        <div class="literary">
            Culture is one of the fundamental aspects that bind people together but
		sometimes, it is what breaks a person. In "The Piece of String," Maitre Hauchecorne of
		Breaute was devastated when he was accused of theft, yet no one ever believed in him
		despite the evidence. Even before his death, he wants to prove to the people living in
		Goderville that he is innocent. A line that capsulized his feelings is, "What grieved me
		was not the thing itself... but it was lies. There's nothing that does you so much harm as
		being in disgrace for lying." The society he belongs to is full of hardworking people, this
		is the reason why they value honesty so much.<br><br>
		Most of the people in Goderville are peasants. Men work hard in plowing and
		reaping corn to sustain their needs. The place where Maitre Hauchecorne went is
		bustling with people since it is quite small. The combined smell of stable, milk, hay, and
		perspiration is part of their daily life that no longer bothers them. The noise made by
		humans and animals is also natural for them. People, especially aristocrats of the plow,
		are used to eating at Mait Jourdains. Eating there is part of their routines. The
		Goderville is more like a political economy rather than a cultural economy. Although
		people know who are, they interact without any emotional connection. The mayor's
		function is to actively engage in whatever is happening in the city. Maitre Hauchecorne
		talks with other people to narrate what happened but the more he talks to them, the
		more the emotional gap expands. People chose to believe Maitre Malandain to Maitre
		Hauchecorne. Since most of them are peasants, they know how hard it is to gain
		money. For this reason, they value honesty. However, despite valuing such a thing, they
		believe in lies. They called him an old rogue and other names. On the other hand,
		Maitre Hauchecorne's willingness to be saved from shame leads him to despair. His
		shameful hiding of a string corrupted his reputation.<br><br>
		Maitre Hauchecorne is an example of a person who's broken by society’s culture.
		There is nothing wrong with valuing honesty, as long as we don’t listen and believe in
		lies being said in our faces. In any way, people will believe what they want to believe
		even if it's not the truth. Sometimes, we don't have to listen to what society dictates
		because they will always find a loophole.

		 <p class="literary-title" onclick="toggleliterary(this)">Definition of Dreams in Guy de Maupassant’s The Necklace</p>
		<div class="literary-author">by Katrina C. Lavador, MAED- ELT</div>
        <div class="literary">
            Guy de Maupassant's "The Necklace" exhibits the consequences of pretending to be
		someone you are not and detaching dreams to reality. Guy de Maupassant grew up in an
		affluent family. He found his inspiration in the deplorable behavior of the bourgeoisie. In the
		story, Mathilde believes that becoming a member of the middle class is undesirable and a
		terrible thing. However, when she loses the necklace she borrowed, she wakes up with her
		fantasies and accepts the reality of her life. Dreams, in the story, are perceived more than
		desires but not less than needs.<br><br>
		In The Necklace, the characters' social standing is given importance since people value
		you depending on the measure of your wealth in society. That is the foremost reason why
		Mathilde wants to be rich. She also wants to stand to compete with other people. Her dreams of
		having an elegant life and luxurious things are out of control. Also, her happiness depends on
		the fancy dresses and jewels she does not own. Mr. Lionel, her husband, is the complete
		opposite of her. He is happy and contented with what he has. That is evident when he sacrifices
		his dreams of going out with his friends. Madame Forestier, on the other hand, did not let fancy
		things deceive and control her even if she were a bourgeoisie. She does not value these
		material things much. Looking into these characteristics depicts that the state's definition of
		dreams is more than just the material things that a person can have. Goals should not be
		measured by earthly commodities since they only give temporary happiness. It will fulfill you at
		first, and then it will advance its demands, and then you will never be satisfied with what you
		have. Further, it conveys that some dreams are not worth trading for with other's dreams while
		some will only remain as dreams.<br><br>
		The story, "The Necklace," parades the importance of combining dreams with reality.
		Reality and dreams should go hand in hand since dreams are more than the desires of a person
		but not less than their needs. Thus, material things should not be the basis for our goals. A
		person's dreams should also be guided by the world to achieve them. It should not dwell on the
		individual's fantasies and imaginations. Rather, dreams should help you in building a good
		reality.

		<p class="literary-title" onclick="toggleliterary(this)">New Criticism Analysis on "The Wedding Dance"</p>
		<div class="literary-author">by Katrina C. Lavador, MAED- ELT</div>
        <div class="literary">
			The story revolves around the characters of Awiyao and Lumnay who separated after
		seven years of marriage because of the tribe's unwritten law. The story is mainly about love,
		sacrifices, and societal expectations. From the feeling of sadness to despair, the persona from a
		third person's point of view was able to transmit this feeling to the readers. Also, the language		
		used is unambiguous and detailed and even the little thing is noticeable. The elements existing
		in the text added excitement and meaning to the story.<br><br>
		The story utilized literary devices well. It used flashbacking to shape the entire narrative
		and to add intensity. Imagery is applied to give a clear picture of how Lumnay suffered from
		Awiyao's decision to marry Madilumay when Lumnay started pulling the rattan flooring. The
		story also exhibits how ironic Awiyao is when he says he does not want any woman but
		Lumnay. However, he proceeded to marry Madilumnay. Throughout the plot, gangsas are heard
		many times. These gangsa represent the tribe's power which Lumnay and Awiyao cannot
		oppose. It also stood as an encouragement for both Awiyao and Lumnay that they must go on
		with their new lives and forget the past they shared. The fire in the story is also essential since it
		signifies the burning love and passion they shared but died down because of the circumstance
		of not bearing a child. The night when the wedding happened mirrors the sadness and seclusion
		Lumnay felt after being replaced by Madilumnay. Moreover, there are two recurring themes
		present in the story. The first theme emphasizes that culture manipulates decisions
		predominantly through love. Even if Awiyao and Madilumnay loved each other wholeheartedly,
		they still were separated because of society's expectations. Another theme is the art of letting
		go because the culture triumphs. Lumnay permitted her husband to go because she knew she
		could not compete with the unwritten law of their tribe.<br><br>
		The story's literary devices worked together to create meaning throughout. The point of
		view makes the character's emotions readable to the readers without ignoring the recurring
		themes and tones. Besides, symbolism, irony, and imagery gave a coherent picture of the story
		without flaws. With these elements, the readers understand what the text says and feels.

		<p class="literary-title" onclick="toggleliterary(this)">Formalistic and Reader Response Analysis of Bonsai by Edith L. Tiempo</p>
		<div class="literary-author">by Katrina C. Lavador, MAED- ELT</div>
        <div class="literary">
			<i>"When love is great, when love is profound, it becomes more difficult to control. And in
		the hands of people who are unable to control it, love overwhelms the person. This is
		the destructive nature of love."</i><br><br>
		The poem "Bonsai" by Edith Tiempo explores the nature of love and the way
		people infuse objects with their love for someone, transforming those objects into
		symbols of that love. Tiempo begins by describing how she "folds" love, making it
		smaller so it can fit into a box, a hollow post, or even a shoe. Since love is abstract and
		intangible, she uses physical objects as representations of it. However, the poem is not
		about love for the objects themselves. Instead, it highlights how love for a person or
		place can be encapsulated in objects that evoke memories of them. These objects,
		small and easy to keep, serve as vessels for memory and love, preserving them in a
		tangible form.<br><br>
		In this way, the objects act as a physical manifestation of love-they can be
		touched and held, and they remain constant even if love itself changes or fades. They
		become evidence of the love that was felt, a testament to its reality because unlike love,
		which is abstract, the objects are concrete. The poem, therefore, is an ode to these
		often-overlooked objects, appreciating how they safeguard cherished memories. Like
		the structure of a bonsai tree, which is meticulously shaped and scaled-down, these
		objects hold profound meaning in their small size. They remind us that even the
		simplest things can preserve a love or memory that should never be forgotten.<br><br>
	<br><b>Structure:</b><br>
		In the first stanza of the poem, Edith Tiempo expresses that everything she loves can
		be folded or kept in small, manageable spaces-a box, a hollow post, or even a shoe.
		This imagery emphasizes how small things are easy to store and preserve, even in the
		most unlikely or challenging places.
		The second stanza expands on this idea, highlighting the ease of keeping memories or
		emotions when they are metaphorically "folded" into smaller, more compact forms.
		Tiempo demonstrates her fondness for minimizing large, abstract concepts like love and
		memory, distilling them into tangible, manageable representations.
		In the third stanza, the poet reflects on the joy and fulfillment found in possessing
		something small and significant, akin to holding a hand-sized object. This act of cupping
		a cherished object brings a sense of comfort and intimacy, underscoring the deep
		admiration and emotional resonance it evokes in the poet's heart.
		Finally, the fourth stanza declares, "And life and love are real." This line affirms that both
		life and love truly exist, especially through the tangible things that hold great personal
		meaning. It suggests that even the smallest objects can carry immense emotional
		weight, serving as powerful symbols of love and memory. Tiempo conveys how these
		seemingly trivial items evoke a breathless sense of wonder and meaning for those who
		appreciate and treasure them.<br><br>
		<br><b>Figurative Language:</b><br>
		The first stanza of the poem exhibits a free verse structure and incorporates various
		literary devices such as repetition, enjambment, and alliteration. The stanza is carefully
		crafted with a rhythmic pattern: lines 1 and 3 consist of 4 syllables, while lines 2 and 4
		contain 5 syllables. The repetition of the word "once" in lines 2 and 3 emphasizes the
		fleeting nature of the moments being described.<br><br>
		<br><i>Literary Devices:</i><br>
		<br><b>Metaphor:</b><br>
		The poem uses the image of a "cupped hand" as a metaphor to convey the act of
		asking for and giving love. This imagery highlights the fundamental human need to love
		and be loved, symbolizing the delicate yet profound exchange between individuals.
		In the line, "Till seashells are broken pieces," the poet presents another metaphor,
		exploring the mystery of how something vast-like the sound of the ocean-can be
		captured in something as small as a seashell. Similarly, the vastness and complexity of
		love can be contained within a small, tangible object, embodying the poem's theme of
		love being simplified and made accessible. The essence of the poem is that love,
		despite its immensity, is distilled into something one can hold in a single hand and pass
		on to another.<br>
		<br><b>Oxymoron:</b><br>
		The poem also employs oxymoron to express the paradoxical nature of love. In the line
		"All that I love?" the interrogative tone prompts a moment of self-examination, which is
		addressed in the following stanza: "Why, yes but for the moment-/ And for all time,
		both." These lines reveal the duality of love-it is both fleeting and eternal. This
		contradiction reflects the reality that love can feel temporary, as it may wane or be
		disrupted by hatred, yet it can also endure as a timeless and eternal force.
		Tiempo further brings love into the realm of the familiar by associating it with everyday
		objects: "Son's note, or Dad's gaudy tie, / A roto picture of a young queen, / A blue
		Indian shawl, even/ A money bill." By referencing these items, she portrays love's
		sublimation-the transformation of something abstract, like an emotion, into something
		concrete, like a physical object. This process makes love tangible, allowing it to be held,
		remembered, and controlled, thus bridging the gap between the intangible and the real.<br>
		<br><b>SO, why bonsai?</b><br>
		One might wonder why the author chose "Bonsai" as the title of the poem when, by
		definition, an ornamental tree or shrub grown in a pot and artificially prevented from
		reaching its normal size. The title, however, serves as a powerful metaphor for the
		poem's theme: love, much like a bonsai, is something that can be nurtured, shaped, and
		contained. The poem explores how love is simplified and reduced into a compact form,
		making it easier to preserve, cherish, and share with others. Just as a bonsai is a
		miniature version of a large tree, love in this poem is portrayed as a distilled version of
		something vast and complex. By shrinking love into something tangible and small, it
		becomes a gift that can be passed down, much like a bonsai tree handed from one
		generation to the next. Thus, the bonsai symbolizes love's ability to endure and adapt,
		embodying the idea that even something as grand as love can be contained within the
		simplest of gestures or objects.
